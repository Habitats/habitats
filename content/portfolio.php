<h4>- Stuff I've made</h4>
<p>Over the years I've somehow managed to spew out a great deal of stuff, ranging from visual design in the early years,
    and slowly converging into more computer science related
    material over the last few years. While all this is great, I felt like I needed a conjoined portal where I could
    showcase and share the one in a million things that didn't turn
    out being utter crap.</p>
<p>I thereby welcome you to my magnificent portfolio, where everything is free and slightly functional.</p>
<p>Happy clickin'!</p>
