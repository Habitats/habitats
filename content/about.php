<h1>who am I?</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Patrick and I'm a nerd. Since you managed to
    stumble upon this page I assume you're either overly interested in my
    work, or is trying to hack me. I would appricaite if you'd refrain from
    doing the latter!</p>

<h2>The purpose</h2>
<p>The purpose of this site is have a conjoined portal where I can
    post and share the stuff I've done. Mainly in the field of computer
    science, but probably other stuff too.</p>
<p>
    <em>Most of the stuff on here is subject to a "do what the heck
        you want"-lisence, so feel free to fork, copy or steal anything you
        find that may be of interest!</em>
